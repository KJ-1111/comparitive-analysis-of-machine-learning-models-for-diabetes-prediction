This study addresses the challenge of accurately predicting diabetes using the Pima Indian Diabetes
 Dataset (PIDD), a problem characterized by complex interactions between various physiological
 features. To tackle this, Seven machine learning models were evaluated: K-Nearest Neighbours, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Classifier, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression and Gradient Boosting. These models were rigorously compared based on
 key performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, and ROC-AUC scores, to
 identify the most effective approach for diabetes prediction.
